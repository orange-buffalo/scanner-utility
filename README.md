# scanner-utility

Utility to scan documents. Built as an Electron app for visual appeal and multiplatform
support. Currently supports eSCL-compatible printers (tested with Cannon TS9060).

Is extensible for other scanner interfaces.

#### Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:9080
npm run dev

```
